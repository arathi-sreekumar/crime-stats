# crime-stats
A small project to show crime stats

Clone the the repository and go to parent folder:

    git clone https://github.com/arathi-sreekumar/crime-stats.git
    cd crime-stats

Dependencies: This project requires node and grunt for set up:

    brew install node
    npm install -g grunt-cli

Install the dependencies in grunt:

    npm install

Use grunt to do everything:

    grunt       // Default runs the build and compiles files
    grunt start // Runs the build and starts the server
    grunt test  // Runs the tests

I have added an option to start server and also launch the browser:

    grunt launch
